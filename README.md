<h1>React-Business-Website</h1>
<h2>By Steve Sande</h2>

<p>The goal of this project was to be introduced to React web development with Typescript.
As such the scope was limited to a single page. The business that the website is for, Interior Ecology, is a small-scale aquarium maintenance business that I own and operate.<p>

<p>To use:
    <ol>
        <li>"npm i" to install dependencies.</li>
        <li>"npx vite" to go live.</li>
        <li>Open the link provided in the terminal output.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>Also accessible using <a href='https://interior-ecology-react.netlify.app/'>Netlify</a>.</p>
