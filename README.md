# React-Business-Website #

The goal of this project was to be introduced to React web development with Typescript and CSS modules.
Therefore the scope was limited to a single page. 
The business that the website is for, Interior Ecology, is a small-scale aquarium maintenance business that I own and operate.
The repo is hosted at https://interior-ecology-react.netlify.app.

Technologies Used:
- React
- TypeScript
- CSS Modules
